How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Testing frequently throughout the SDLC is the key factor in ensuring that the final code is functional and secure. Having the testing performed
by others within a development team will also help catch bugs in the program because there is less bias present as opposed to developing and checking
your own code.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Developing a requirements document and asking the user follow-up questions which are related to each requirement is a great tool to use when 
interpreting user's needs.


How do I approach designing software?

My approach to developing software is to first have a very clear understanding of the customer's requirements, both functional and non-functional.
Documenting these requirements in a requirements document will later be used to help develop models like flowcharts. I then start writing psuedocode
before I begin to code and start worrying about the syntax of the programming language being used.
